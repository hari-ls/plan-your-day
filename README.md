# Plan Your Day

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

- This project was a part of a coding bootcamp activity, as homework.
- The user story, acceptance criteria and a start code was provided.
- This calendar application uses HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery, MomentJS, CSS and JavaScript with LocalStorage to save the contents of the time block.
- Building this application helped understand how to use third party APIs particulary - jQuery, MomentJS & Bootstrap.
